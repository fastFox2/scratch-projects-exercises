# scratch-projects-exercises
I have made this projects for school. Feel free to contribute or give sugguestions in the "issues"-section. But I can't implement all suguestions.

## Frosch.sb3
After you have given the asked values, you jump with spacebar.You end every frog with the Up-Arrow. You can now choose between another frog (anything except "ja") and the end of the end of the competition (type "ja"). Then the referee shows up again and gives the result of the competition.

# Contributing
The only thing to know is that you are not allowed to commit directly to the main-branch. Always start a PR and wait until I've seen it. Only ME accepts PR. NOT you.
